    "Over time, blightsources have been organized into groupings based on apparent features. This system of organization differs from region to region, but the Shrouded Theocracy uses a list of six major categories, each with subcategories clustered within. These are: 'Blightstones', 'Blightichors', 'Blightfumes', 'Blightflora', 'Blightfungi', and 'Blightanomalies'.",
    "Some blightsources are more or less useful than others. Some can be used as fuel, as magical catalysts, molded into armor, or store magical energies, among other applications. The Blightbane Guild serves as the most prominent buyer, consumer, and distributer of most varieties of blightsources. This is their major source of income, and the backbone upon which they pay their staff, contractors, and bankroll research endeavors.",
    "Some Blight Seekers specialize in harvesting and transporting blightsources. They are known as 'Harvesters', but among them are the porters and guards. This work is more lucrative than taking on blightbeast culling contracts, but it comes with a unique set of risks. They must collect resources in a battlefield where they must trust that their guards can protect them, focusing on extracting what they need without damaging the product. For this reason, the Guild requires that all Harvesters be full seekers, trained to defend themselves if need be. However, if a Harvester needs to defend themselves, it is often too late."

        "Blightstones are primarily harvested using miner's picks, or jeweler's chisels for the more delicate Crystali. Some guilds, however, have the resources to equip their harvesters with magitech harvesting tools, or equipment of wholly mechanical make. These guilds are few and far between, and they are discouraged by regular losses to blightbeasts, or high maintenance costs of expensive and fickle equipment."

Their worth is inflated due to the metals being difficult to work with and even more difficult to find a use for. Predicting how a blightfoil will interact with any given spell is tricky. Mages are notoriously reckless, but who uses a blightfoil catalyst is going a step further than the norm in regards to disregard for personal safety.",
            "The most popular blightfoil would have to be forslone, which effectively cloaks the bearer in a magically repellant shield. It is more complicated than that, but defense against magic is one thing anyone will upend their coin purses for. Other metals are sometimes used for decoration, such as the beautiful voidshimmer, with its midnight black base, full of everlasting purple sparkles."

For this reason, they are used as vessels for energy, and portable spell containers. Some crystali are durable enough to expend the stored spell multiple times, but these are rare, and most simple shatter once they are used.",
            "As disposable as these materials are, a merchant is always willing to buy one, no matter how small the crystal fragment may be. Harvesting them is no easy task. They are prone to shattering at the lightest touch. That goes doubly for using them to store a spell. Commonly, vitality and clarity shards are formed from small crystals of apertrite, which is the least expensive crystali on the market."

In this way, a harvest crew can leave a small portion of easily-accessible leylode untouched, until it grows enough to tap into once more. That is, if another crew hasn't gotten their first.",
            "Harvesting leylodes is easy enough, as the real chore is transporting any sizable quantity out of the festerfont and getting a good price for it. Fortunately, the price of charke, the most commonly encountered leylode, is always high enough to make it worth the effort. The Guild will always buy other leylodes, especially curos, for which they remain the sole buyer."

Gatherers of blightvenoms are an odd sort, even among seekers. They stand out, rarely bonding with their defending seekers, and their closest friends are usually other blightvenom harvesters and the deathdealers whom they sell to.",

This is especially the case with ill-understood substances, like most blightsources.

Sometimes, a concoction will make use of the beneficial properties of this altered perception, at the cost of detrimental affects. It is difficult to argue that any given blightmare is entirely harmless. A willing subject may tolerate the affects of a blightmare, but they do so at their own risk.",
            "This blightichor variant is named after an ancient belief that the Blight contains many trickster spirits. Supposedly, these spirits enjoy toying with sapient creatures, delighting in their reactions. Most civilized parts of Shroud have shrugged off such superstitions, in large part motivated by cultural purges conducted by knights and enforcers, but wilderness villages will sometimes conduct rituals using blightmares to commune with spirits, exchanging drug-borne entertainment for whatever the wants of the villagers may be. Sometimes, there are even rumors of spirits granting these requests."

There is always a tradeoff in using rushblight to perform. The consequences of a crash at the wrong time can lead to death, and it can also be death, depending on the inhalant. Sometimes, seekers will carry a dose of rushblight to take if things get chancy, only to take if they find their back against the wall.",

When stress and tight budgets cause riskier and riskier behavior, a seeker relying on rushblight to make ends meet might have to quit the profession. However, it doesn't end there. They are reliant on rushblight, even if it is no longer necessary for them. Rushblight is expensive, so these ex-seekers turn to crime to buy more, and it only goes poorly from there."

A blightsnarl does not need any of the resources it discovers. The function of the mapping behavior is unclear.", "One recent revelation is that blightsnarls only appear within 'command' configuration festerfonts, or where there are nearby neighboring command festerfonts. Disrupting blightsnarl networks growing around a festerfont will hinder the ability for a command festerfont to communicate with its neighbors, though, it is only one such communication mechanism a command type employs. Researchers believe blightsnarls will eventually be harvested for use in pseudo-biological computation technology, using the material's innate networking specialization to allow sentients to communicate across vast distances.
