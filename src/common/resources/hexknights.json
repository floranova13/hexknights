Galar is a subject in the Orchestrator experiment, but he wasn't given the choice or the information Caim received. He is sixteen, but Shroud recognizes him as a holy vessel of the divine. Many devout believers see the power Galarious wields and his androgynous form and think that he was made in Nosk's image. Even those who never believed in the Covenant of Shade, secretly going along with the religion, gained faith when they saw Galarious's first bloody fight on the border in the dead zone. He appeared there, confused and alone, and the monstrous aggressors wanted to capture him because he was human. It was him against tens of them, but he cast a strange magic that seemed to turn the violent actions of his enemies against them. Strangely, he wasn't as affected by the attacks as his enemies were. Shroud soldiers watched in amazement as the foes were cut down by their own attacks. When it was over, some Shroud forces began to pray before Galarious, and Galarious reacted by going with the flow. Despite being an obvious foreigner who claimed to be from another world, he was welcomed into Shroud and quickly a appointed to be a Hexaline Knight. Galarious's magic was not without a price, however, all would soon find out. It sapped his vitality in a strange way, halting his aging process and weakening him for a period of time after using his power. Some have pointed out that his power isn't very forgiving, wounding all who try to harm him, but others point out that he doesn't attack. Some wonder whether Galar will grow up to learn how to manipulate people using the faith they have in him, learning to use the religious guise of forgiveness to inspire loyalty, or whether he will find this tactic distastful. Galarious looks for things to occupy his mind with. He allows others to make claims that he is always looking for new things to forgive. Galarious has gained such a devoted following that it occasionally worries him. He communicates with his Paragon and officials in the theocracy leadership to make sure rivals do not see him as a threat. He does not want to enjoy himself so much that his life is cut short. Galar is mixed. He is self-indulgent and doesn't really embody the godly traits others who put him on a pedestal think he does, but their obsession with him begins to mold him, just a little, into a better person.",

      "description": "Relica's life has been tormented by the fickle influence of magic enough times to leave her with a permanent distaste for it. She likes things simple, and believes magic's worth as a tool is overshadowed by it's capacity to ruin any who use it. Shroud uses her passion whenever there is need to eliminate a mage or magic tool without wishing for it to be recovered. Relica will not recover tools of magic, and she will not use magic herself either. The purest faith does not require some kind of magical intervention to rally belief. Relica has commissioned special lanterns that she uses to disrupt the flow of magic by switching fuel sources in different situations to project an area-of-effect distortion around her.",

Demetra and her knights hunt traitos, bandits, and anyone else, much like a Knightmare would. Her knights are instructed to give the final kill to their lord. They believe she is sparing them the sin, and taking the burdon on her conscious in their place, but that is not so. She must kill to maintain her power. Even though she wishes it were not so, it is her price. Demetra does not want to kill, but she does it because she believes the price is worth it. Balancing the lives of all those she wants to heal again the criminals she must dispatch, she continues on as she does.",

      "description": "Harth is a woman without purpose. Many terrible and not so terrible things have happened in her life, but they didn't leave many lasting impressions. Instead, she did as she was told until she gained recognition for her remarkable endurance. After serving for years on the border, she became a veteran at a respectable age of 35. However, she eventually learned that her mother and father, the only family she knew, had been killed in a random act of criminal violence. Her superiors closely observed her behavior after that. She mourned and cried, but she didn't obsess over thoughts of vengeance or anything of the like. For this reason, she was eventually flagged as a candidate for a knight unit. Her combat style was generic Shroud military, but it was her level-headed, stable attitude that caught the attention of the would-be Paragon of Resilience. She wasn't just appointed as a knight, but offered the esteemed position of Hexaline Knight. This came after a single question about her family. The criminals were still out there, why didn't she seek them out? She answered that she can't bring the dead back to life. While it was true that the criminals should be caught, there are others in the position to find them and make them pay for their crimes. Any actions on her part would only get in their way. However, now that she has her position as a Hexaline Knight of Resilience, she is trying to find a purpose. One that won't force her to give up her strengths. Harth is extremely straight-edged. Some might call her cold, as she's detached from her own emotional motivations while on duty.",
